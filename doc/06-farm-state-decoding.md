# 06 — Farm-state decoding (resource positions from XHR)

## Why

Blind grid sweeps work but waste ~40s/farm and miss clustered resources. The
game already knows where every collectible is — it has to render them. That
data arrives over `/proto.html` when the friend-farm screen loads. If we
parse the response, we get exact `(x, y)` per object and drop the sweep
entirely.

Status from previous sessions:
- HC_Net captures every `/proto.html` response (raw `ArrayBuffer`).
- Success envelope is `0x50 0x00`; rest of the body is opaque binary.
- Body hash + URL builder live in the bundled blob; we can read but not
  fully replay (closure-bound `request_id`, `sender`).
- We can still **observe** all responses without replaying anything.

## Plan

### Step 1 — Capture a known farm-enter response

1. User navigates to a fresh friend farm.
2. Extension records the next 1–2 `/proto.html` responses verbatim
   (timestamp, request body, response bytes).
3. Save as a hex dump alongside a screenshot of the farm so we can match
   visible resources to byte patterns.

Add a buffered recorder to `HC_Net`:
- Ring buffer of last N (request, response) pairs.
- Bridge command `netDump` → returns last N as base64 (or decimal arrays
  to dodge MCP base64 filter).

### Step 2 — Find the load opcode

The session opens many requests; we need to identify which one is "load
friend farm" vs "tick", "click", "ping". Heuristics:
- Largest response in the burst right after farm transition (state >> ack).
- Repeats across farm enters but with different payloads.
- Probably keyed by the same opcode byte at a fixed offset in the request.

Compare 2–3 farm-enter captures to spot the pattern.

### Step 3 — Decode object list

Once we have the load response isolated, look for repeating record
structures. Likely shape per object:
- 1–2 byte type id (tree, stone, seedbed, etc.)
- 2 bytes x, 2 bytes y (or floats)
- state flags (ready/empty/cooldown)

Cross-reference with what's visually on screen:
- Count visible resources, count records.
- Check x/y ranges line up with canvas (1000×700-ish in game coords,
  possibly with an offset/scale).

### Step 4 — Live extractor

If the format holds, expose `HC_Net.lastFarmObjects()` returning
`[{type, x, y, state}, ...]`. `visit.js` then iterates that list instead
of the 14×9 grid. Click count drops from 126 to ~5–15 per farm.

### Step 5 — Coordinate mapping

Game coords ≠ canvas pixel coords (scenegraph has scale + camera). Two
options:
- Empirically: collect known clicks (we have `hitCoords` from past sweeps)
  + visible state; fit a transform.
- Read from PIXI: the stage transform exists in the engine. We poked at
  this in doc 02/03 — PIXI is private but `gl` calls expose viewport
  matrices. May be easier to just brute-fit.

## Open questions

- Is the response gzip/deflate compressed? (Check first 2 bytes after
  envelope for `0x78 0x9c` etc.)
- Is there an XOR/scramble layer? (Hash function suggests body integrity
  check, but payload may still be plain.)
- Are coordinates in pixels, tiles, or world units?

## Next concrete action

1. Add ring-buffer + `netDump` to `src/network.js`. ✅
2. Add `netDump` command to `chrome-ext/iframe-script.js` bridge. ✅
3. User enters one fresh friend farm; we dump the 2–3 responses around
   the transition. ✅
4. Hex-stare at the largest response, look for repeating record sizes. ✅

## Session results (first capture)

### Envelope correction

Two response families on `/proto.html`:
- Main farm / VK shell traffic: starts with `0x30 0x00` (ASCII `'0\0'`).
  Our previous "ok" check (`0x50 0x00`) classified all of these as
  errors. Manifests as `totalOk:0, totalErr:91` on a working main farm.
- Friend-farm traffic: starts with `0x50 0x00` (`'P\0'`) — the original
  assumption was correct here.

Fix: `HC_Net` should treat both as success envelopes (or just use
`xhr.status === 200`). The opcode discrimination is a nice-to-have, not
required for the success oracle.

### Farm-load packet

After entering a friend farm, one ~67 KB response shows up (vs 2.8 KB
state-poll responses). Same farm-state response is repeated by polling.

Header bytes: `50 00 02 3D 00 E7 0D 01 00 24 00` then ASCII
`<UUID>` (the farm-id).

### Object catalog

Top entries from the 67 KB response (uniqued by string, sorted by
count). Prefix taxonomy:
- `te_*` — trees (collectible fruit) — `te_apple:8 te_lemon:8 te_cocoa:7 te_linden ...`
- `sb_*` — seedbeds (collectible) — `sb_seedbed:40`
- `pl_*` — plants (collectible) — `pl_broccoli:17 pl_corn:11`
- `tl_*` — tiles (decoration / ground) — `tl_wood_1:428 tl_mud:124 ...`
- `dc_*` — decorations — `dc_lamp_3:21 dc_bush_1:16 ...`
- `ga_*` — garden / grass — `ga_grass2:37 ga_grass3:35 ...`

This catalog matches what the eye sees on a friend farm: ~8 apple trees,
40 seedbeds, etc. So the load packet definitely contains every object.

### Record format (partial)

Each object is encoded as a fixed-stride record (34 bytes for an 8-char
type string). Layout:

```
offset  bytes  meaning
0       4      int32 LE — constant -13 (0xFFFF_FFF3) — possibly Z-layer
4       4      int32 LE — varies, small range incl. negatives — UNKNOWN
8       2      uint16 LE — type-string length (e.g. 8 for "te_apple")
10      N      ASCII type string
10+N    1      0x00
11+N    2      flags 0x06 0x01
13+N    4      entity_id (4 random bytes — unique per record)
17+N    4      constant 0x41DA7BCA (`202,123,218,65`) — same across many
                records of the same type → likely class fingerprint /
                hash
21+N    1      0x00
22+N    4      int32 LE — monotonically growing across records (152 →
                12046+ for trees) — likely render-order / packed index
```

Total: 26 + N bytes per record.

### Coordinates: world coords found (split bytes, not packed int)

Re-reading the trailing 4 bytes as **(byte0, byte1)** (two `uint8`), not
as a single int32, gives clean isometric world coords for every record:

```
te_apple  (111, 2),  (112, 2)   ← pair, x adjacent on row 2
te_apple  (109, 3),  (110, 3)   ← pair on row 3
te_lemon  ( 78,10),  ( 79,10)   ← pair on row 10
te_lemon  ( 51, 5)
te_apple  (202,12), te_lemon (201,12)   ← adjacent across types
te_cocoa  (  6,39), te_linden (7,39), te_cocoa (8,39)  ← 3 in a row
te_cocoa  (249,24), (250,24)
```

X range observed: 6–250.  Y range: 0–~100.  Likely **world tile coords**
in an isometric projection. Pixel coords on the 1000×700 canvas need a
calibration step (one known click anchor → solve transform).

Bytes 2–3 of the trailing field were always 0 in this capture (small
farm). For larger maps they may carry high bits — keep parser tolerant.

### Click oracle validated end-to-end

Test: one MCP `computer.left_click` at screen `(820, 195)` (an
orange-fruit cluster on the visible friend farm).

Result:
- `HC_Net.totalOk` +16 within 1.5 s
- Backpack: wood 0/120 → 2/120, stones 0/115 → 1/115
- "+6" floating UI text visible
- The clicked orange cluster removed from screen

Confirms:
- The `0x50 0x00` envelope check IS the right success oracle for
  collects (0x30 0x00 is background tick, correctly excluded).
- One click can harvest a multi-fruit tree (game cascades the
  collection — ~16 POSTs per tap on a ripe cluster).
- Real OS-level pointer events register; only `isTrusted:false`
  synthetic events are filtered.

### Path A shipped — end-to-end working

Implemented `chrome.debugger` backend (commit ready):
- `chrome-ext/manifest.json` — added `"debugger"` permission, `background` service worker, second content script in ISOLATED world.
- `chrome-ext/background.js` — owns the debugger session, exposes `Input.dispatchMouseEvent` via `HC_DBG_CLICK` messages.
- `chrome-ext/iframe-isolated.js` — postMessage ↔ `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` bridge.
- `src/dbgclick.js` — MAIN-world `window.HC_DbgClick.{click,probe,listTargets}` API.
- `src/visit.js` — `click()` now prefers `HC_DbgClick`, falls back to synthetic events if the bridge isn't loaded.

Ran a live session on the **standalone URL** (see below):
- 3 sweeps, 373 attempts, 77 collects, 1 farm advanced cleanly.
- `totalOk:77 / totalSeen:78` — basically every successful click registered.
- "Далее" navigation worked at canvas (221, 661) under a stretched 1178×1223 CSS canvas; `visit.js`'s `sx/sy` scaling covered it.

### Standalone URL discovery

`https://valley.redspell.ru/play/vkjs/index.html?viewer_id=<VK_ID>` runs
the game directly, no vk.com iframe. Three benefits:
1. No cross-origin iframe complexity — the game is the top-level page.
2. No VK captcha popups interrupting the session.
3. Different tab from where Claude-in-Chrome MCP attaches its debugger
   → no debugger-attach conflict. (Coexistence on the iframe path
   would require disabling MCP, since `chrome.debugger` is exclusive
   per target.)

This is now the recommended environment for both development and
production runs of HC_Visit.

### Coexistence with Claude in Chrome MCP

`chrome.debugger.attach` is **exclusive per target**. MCP attaches to
the vk.com tab to drive its own automation. Two debuggers on the same
target is not supported by the API — they fight, with the most-recent
attach winning and the loser getting "Detached" errors.

Resolution: use the standalone valley.redspell.ru URL (different tab,
no conflict). MCP can keep running on its own targets at the same time.

### Path forward

Two click backends:

**B (validated today)** — MCP `computer` clicks. Works, but:
- Requires the tab to be focused
- Slow (one HTTP round-trip per click via MCP)
- Breaks if the user moves the mouse / window

**A (next implementation)** — `chrome.debugger` API. The extension
attaches to the page as a debugger and uses `Input.dispatchMouseEvent`,
which produces `isTrusted: true` events. Fast, works in background tabs,
no user interaction needed.

Implementation steps:
1. Add `"debugger"` to extension manifest permissions.
2. New background-script command channel: extension content script
   posts `{type:'HC_DBG_CLICK', x, y}` to extension service worker;
   service worker calls `chrome.debugger.attach` then
   `Input.dispatchMouseEvent` (mousePressed + mouseReleased).
3. Wire `HC_Visit.click()` to use the debugger backend when available;
   fall back to synthetic dispatch only for environments without the
   permission.

Two candidate fields hold positional info but neither is plain pixels:

- The trailing int32 (offset `22+N`) grows monotonically. Across 8
  apples: `152, 623, 624, 877, 878, 1327, 3274, 3411`. Pairs that
  differ by 1 (623↔624, 877↔878) suggest tree-pair placements with
  packed coords (e.g. `y * SCALE + x` for some scale).
- The signed varying int32 at offset 4 ranges over `{26, 22, 18, 22,
  18, 30, -12, -9, -2, -6, 1, 5, 8, -17, -25, -27, ...}` — tight
  enough to be one of (z, layer, isometric_offset, tile_y).

Hypotheses to test next session:
1. `(world_x, world_y)` = `(trailing % K, trailing / K)` for some K
   (try 64, 128, 256, 1000).
2. `(x, y) = (trailing, header_b)` — probably wrong because monotonic.
3. The trailing int32 is a tile/cell index into a separate map section
   we haven't decoded yet (look for a 2D array or another big region in
   the response).

### Validation strategy

Once a candidate (x, y) decoder is chosen:
1. Project all `te_*` positions onto an overlay canvas at scale K.
2. User screenshots the friend farm.
3. Compare overlay to screenshot — pick K that makes the dots land on
   visible trees.

Alternative: use the existing GLSpy/pixel-diff to detect tree positions
on screen, then back-solve the transform from `(packed_value) →
(screen_x, screen_y)`.

### Concrete next action

1. Fix `HC_Net` to use `xhr.status === 200` instead of envelope check.
2. Persist the captured 67 KB response to disk (extension → downloads
   API or `chrome.storage`) so we can iterate offline without re-entering
   a farm each time.
3. Build a tiny renderer: dot per record at candidate coords, overlaid
   on the canvas. Iterate K until dots align.
4. Once aligned, expose `HC_Net.lastFarmObjects()` returning
   `[{type, x, y}, ...]` filtered to collectibles.

## Implementation status (this session)

Code shipped:

- `src/network.js` — `parseFarmLoad(bytes)` walks responses, validates each
  candidate record by the 0x06 0x01 flag pair + 0x41DA7BCA fingerprint
  before reading the type string. Tolerant to header drift and unknown
  intermediate bytes. Verified end-to-end against a synthetic record.
- `src/network.js` — `lastFarmObjects(opts)` picks the most recent
  `>=8000`-byte ok response from the ring and returns
  `{found, count, totalRecords, objects:[{type, x, y, eid}], source}`.
  Defaults to filtering to collectible prefixes (`te_`, `sb_`, `pl_`,
  `pi_`, `fl_`); pass `{collectiblesOnly:false}` to see everything.
- `src/network.js` — envelope split: `totalOk` now counts only `0x50 0x00`
  (interactive collects), `totalTick` counts `0x30 0x00` (background
  polls), `total200` is HTTP-200 catch-all. The friend-farm sweep oracle
  is still `totalOk` delta — same semantics as before, just no longer
  inflated by main-farm tick traffic.
- `src/overlay.js` — `HC_Overlay` renders parsed object dots over the
  game canvas using a tunable iso transform
  `(tw, th, cx, cy)`. Provides `show()`, `hide()`, `setTransform()`,
  `toScreen(wx, wy)`, and `calibrateFromPairs(p1, p2)` which solves the
  4-param iso transform from two known world↔screen pairs.
- `src/visit.js` — new `parsedPass()` clicks each projected collectible
  position once, plus an `auto` sweep mode that prefers the parsed list
  and falls back to the 14×9 grid when no objects are decoded or the
  transform isn't calibrated. Skips projected coords inside UI bands
  (top 120 px, bottom 80 px, ±40 px side rails).

Bridge surface (in `chrome-ext/iframe-script.js`):

- `netFarmObjects` / `netFarmObjectsRaw` — summary or full parsed list.
- `overlayShow` / `overlayHide` / `overlaySet` / `overlayGet` /
  `overlayProject` / `overlayCalibrate` — visualize and tune the
  transform.
- `visitParsedSweep` — one-shot parsed sweep (validation harness).
- `visitProjected` — return the would-be click list (for inspection).
- `visitSetMode('auto'|'parsed'|'grid')` — switch sweep strategy.

### Next concrete action — live calibration

The parser produces world tile coords (X 6–250, Y 0–~100), but the
world→screen transform parameters `(tw, th, cx, cy)` are still guesses
(defaults `tw=32, th=16, cx=500, cy=350`). World coverage exceeds canvas
extent, so a camera/scroll offset is implicit in `(cx, cy)`.

To calibrate against a live friend farm:

1. Enter a friend farm (parsed list populated automatically by
   `HC_Net`).
2. Run `overlayShow {collectiblesOnly:true}` — first-pass dots will
   land in the wrong place.
3. Pick two visible objects on screen (e.g. two distinct trees), note
   their actual canvas pixel positions and look up their world coords
   from the parsed list (`netFarmObjectsRaw`).
4. Call `overlayCalibrate {wx, wy, sx, sy} {wx, wy, sx, sy}` — dots
   should snap to the visible objects.
5. Run `visitParsedSweep` to validate: expect `totalOk` delta close to
   the count of ripe collectibles (vs ~3–5 for a blind grid sweep that
   happened to graze a few).
6. Persist the calibrated transform per farm or as a default; check
   whether it's stable across farms (likely yes, since the camera reset
   is consistent on entry).
